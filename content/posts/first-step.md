I'm changing my domain name. Again.

_A little background here._ My name is Ning Kuang. Actually, it's Kuang Ning (<ruby>匡宁 <rp>(</rp><rt>kuāng níng</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>). In Chinese, we put our family names before given names. I was born and raised in China, moved to the States in 2018.

People had been addressing me by “Alex” since primary school; back then, having an English name was a cool thing. That name is by no means relevant to my ethnicity. It makes me feel like a cultural imposter and betrayer. So now I wanna ditch it.

But that's not an easy thing to do -- for me and for others. And this is my **first step** -- switching my domain name from `alex0.dev` to `kuang.dev`.
